## Game Overview

Eldoria Battlestorm is a turn-based strategy game where players control a team of characters, each with unique abilities. The objective is to strategically outmaneuver your opponent and deplete their characters' health to win the game.

### Characters

Each character has the following attributes:

- **mint**: Unique identifier for the character.
- **health**: Health points of the character.
- **hit**: Attack power of the character.
- **xp**: Experience points of the character.

### Game State

The game state is managed by the `GameState` struct, which includes:

- **is_initialized**: Indicates if the game is initialized.
- **initializer**: Public key of the player who initialized the game.
- **guest**: Public key of the guest player.
- Character attributes for both initializer and guest.
- **last_play_time**: Timestamp of the last move.
- **whose_turn**: Indicates whose turn it is to play.

### Actions

Players can perform actions such as:

- **Attack**: Engage in combat with the opponent's characters.
- **Move**: Move characters strategically on the board (implementation details pending).

## Smart Contracts

The core game logic is implemented in Rust using Borsh for serialization. The key structs are:

- `RandomNumber`: Represents a random number for game mechanics.
- `GameState`: Manages the state of the game.
- `Character`: Defines the attributes of a character.
- `Attack`: Represents an attack action.
- `PlayerAccount`: Tracks player stats.

## Building and Running

Compile the smart contracts:

```sh
cargo build-bpf
```

Deploy the contracts to the Solana blockchain:

```sh
solana program deploy path/to/your_program.so
```

Run the Unity frontend (if applicable):

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
